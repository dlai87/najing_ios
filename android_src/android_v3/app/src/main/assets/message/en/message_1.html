<p><strong>How do the dermatological doctors from the top hospitals think of the Najing bright and moisture?</strong></p>
<p>The Second Seminar about &ldquo;Accelerating Penetrating and Clinical Application of Nano-tech&rdquo; was launched by the World Traditional Chinese medicine committee and transdermal drug delivery committee in Suzhou, March 5th, in 2016.</p>
<p>Nano-technology in Accelerating Nutrient Penetrating was given the dermatological experts more potential for medical cosmetology and daily skincare in innovative treatment for just a few months away from the first seminar.</p>
<p>Dr. Xu, as the CEO of Suzhou Natong, was invited for the seminar in Suzhou, including more than forty experts.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the dermatological representatives getting together, and they are so honoured to give views of Nano-technology in Accelerating Nutrient Penetrating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly praised that Professor Luo made 15 minutes&rsquo; speech to share us with the medical method of chloasma by nano-crystal chips with tranexamic acid.</p>
<p>As we know, It was widely applied for beauty and skincare to use the newest accelerating-penetrating technology of nano-crystal chips. However, what the customers doesn&rsquo;t know about is that, before it comes to the market, the nano-tech tooks Dr. Xu&rsquo;s research-team 15 years old to research and develop, and got application in domestic clinical medicine.Every expert gave their own views about the application of nano-crystal chips on beauty, skincare, dermatosis medicine and Chinese traditional medical transdermal drug delivery in the discuss.</p>

<p>Bingwen Liang, as the president of the World Traditional Chinese Medicine committee and transdermal drug delivery committee, who was interested in &ldquo;small bridges over the flowing stream of Suzhou&rdquo;, reviewed the first seminar significance of the development of transdermal drug delivery and agreed with the effect of this seminar. Then it was suggested that it&rsquo;s worth sharing our successful application cases of nano-tech with all the representatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu, the president of Information Research Institution of Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine, agreed with the good prosperity of the nano-crystal chip helping accelerating nutrients penetrating and the availability from all the fields, then looked forward to the application on pyonex and acupuncture and moxibustion in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<p>Wei Liu, Dean of General Hospital from the Air Force of Chinese People's Liberation Army from dermatology, briefly made the status analysis of domestic skincare cream with the topic of &ldquo;Transdermic Adsorption in Making the Face Skin Younger&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s essential for the transform of skincare market to maintain &ldquo;high efficiency&rdquo; the principle now instead of &ldquo;safety&rdquo; at past.</p>
<p>Compared with the unstability of a lot of chemical accelerating-penetrate reagent, the physical accelerating-penetrate technology was in favor for the domestic experts. The nano-tech of Najing bright and moisture become the first significant technology of transmitting hyaluronic acid noninvasively among all the physical technologies such as light, electricity, ultrasonics and micro-needle.</p>

<p>The nano-crystal chip, the diameter be 1/1000 times of micro-needle, was widely applied on the clinical research about chloasma with tranexamic acid by professor Luo from People&rsquo;s Hospital of Jiangsu Province, and got better medical efficiency and less pain.She also gave views about appling the nano-crystal chip for mesoblast medicine of many kinds of dermatosis and the distinctive efficiency of brighten and moisture needle by Najing.</p>
<img src="../img/message_1_fig_4.png" class="center fit"/>
<p>Yuanhong Li, the vice director of the first hospital of Chinese Medical University from dermatology, was the founder of beauty-loving doctor from self-media in the beauty medicine field.Professor Li had a lot of clinical experience in the application on dermatosis medicine by the nano-crystal chips, and shared much successfully with us about alopecia.</p>
<p>"The amyloidosis of skin" is a problem giving great pain of patients, and &ldquo;beely diversification " become trouble from teenagers.The same feature of these two diseases is that there&rsquo;s a large medical cost and a little efficiency. The first one to use nano-crystal chip treatment with tartaric acid by professor Tian in clinical medicine, helped improve the efficiency of dermatology obviously and relieved the pain.</p>
<img src="../img/message_1_fig_5.png" class="center fit"/>
<p>It took nine years old for the director named Hua Zhao from the No.301 General Hospital of Beijing to get together with the nano-crystal chip, and she held on lots of opinions for this clinical research. It&rsquo;s confirmed of the safety and efficiency of nano-crystal chips.Then she suggest that a new medical method of transmission without trauma could extend, because of the good result from cuticle anesthesia and acne by Najing.</p>
<p>The nano-crystal chip would give much potential for the development of Chinese medicine when it comes to the expert named Lu Zhang, who is in favour of needle-controlling.He believed that, he would use the very nano-crystal chip to solve the problem of many disease like the head herpes zoster on the base of its breakthrough.<br />At the same time, he put forward the new international tour projects about skincare and brightening, by connecting "nano-crystal chips" with "the palace method of empress Cixi".</p>
<p><br />with the very attitude on the innovative high-tech, implement the research process from the director of Qingrui Zhang. When knowing "nano" for the first time, he verified many applied technologies like &ldquo;subcutaneous import of nano-crystal&rdquo; and &ldquo;nano-crystal openning channel&rdquo; by the experiment of "fluorescence of rats&rdquo;. And these new technologies provided important references for numerous experts. He thought that, Dr. Xu, as the inventor of the nano-crystal chips, was a very rigorous scientist, made his product widely applied on skincare and opening the skin barrier.</p>
<p><br />The event host :Suzhou Natong Biological nano-tech co., LTD. The founder of the company, Dr Xu, also the inventor of the "nano-crystal chip" technology, took deep exchange with all the experts in the meeting. Nano-crystal chip, as an innovative technology in the process of development and research of global transdermal drug delivery was achieved 12 invention patents, respectively include 9 domestic and 3 abroad, and gained popularity and recognition in a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>The future, has come. It will become a new milestone of the development process in the transdermal drug delivery field.</p>
