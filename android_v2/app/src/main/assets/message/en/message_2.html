<p><strong>What is Najing?</strong></p>
<p><br />It&rsquo;s applied for the field of transdermal drug delivery which called Najing nano-crystal chips with monocrystalline&nbsp;Si (short for the element called Silicon) is based on the IT and the material science breakthrough. Najing nano-crystal chips used by micro-machining and sculpturing technology with 99.99% high purity monocrystalline&nbsp;Si, and less than 80 nm at the peak, touching height 80-300um, can not damage the dermis layer to ensure the skin integrity, by penetrating the outmost cuticle called the skin absorption barrier in the medicine. It helps open the permeability channels of our skin safe and fast, accelerates nutrients to the interior and improves the nutrient-absorption significantly. Therefore, it&rsquo;s further advanced in micro-needle field, with none of pain and damage. That, about 1000 times smaller than the traditional micro-needle, is the revolutionary tool in the bio-medical permeability branch, getting safer and more convenient, more efficiently.</p>
<p>The characteristics of Najing, the newest technology researched about 20 years old in Silicon Valley, USA <br />1. Own the only global invention about nano-crystal chips and the product has been on stream;<br />2. The only founder of nano-crystal chips who has 12 autonomous invention patents;<br />3. The only global brand of nano-crystal chips is selected in "HBA Global" beauty tools classification;<br />4. The only brand verified by many dermatologists clinically from lots of top-three hospitals and becoming the special guest getting breakthrough in American dermatology anniversary convention in 2011.</p>
<p>1.Three advantages of nano-crystal chips <br />1. Safe, no pain, non-wound and non-trace, <br />Nano-crystal chips can help open the tenacious cuticle of the skin, but not touching to the dermis and above, so there&rsquo;s no pain and trauma, and the channels will be turned off about 20 minutes. It&rsquo;s very safe with no trace.</p>

<p>2. Efficient permeability <br />The skin used by Najing nano-crystal chips which open hundreds of channels in just a few square millimeters, gets more than 10 times in improving the ability of nutrient-absorbing, accelerating the nutrients permeate efficiently.</p>

<p>3. Easy operation<br />Professional beauty, daily nursing, medical field.<br />Patent of Najing <br />When it comes, our product, Najing nano-crystal chips, had gotten 12 invention patents, respectively 9 from American and 3 from China, won many awards in the world-wide, Thus it has broadcasted by CCTV, French TV, WSJ and Forbes of USA, well received by nearly 10 million users. Our company shortly called Suzhou Natong got financing help from SBCVC and QF Capital.</p>
